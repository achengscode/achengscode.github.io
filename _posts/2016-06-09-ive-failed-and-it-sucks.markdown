title: I've failed and I feel terrible
---

Imagine this: a young software developer, still in school, and trying to make a little extra money to
supplement their living (and trying to avoid being a starving university student). So what does that
student do? 

Take on a side project!

Initially the side project consumes most of the student's life outside of school, and the side project
seems simple enough. It's a simple CRUD web application built for people that don't have much technical
experience, and it allows the student to get their feet wet by developing actual production-level 
code. 

But wait! The student developer (looking for actual work) finds an enterprise job at a fairly renowned
company, and the side project falls to the wayside (due to commitments from the new job, finishing school
and life in general). 

Fast forward for two years, and the developer has moved on. The side project itself has been abandoned in all
sense of the word. The clients themselves haven't been in contact with the developer, until one day, 
they come back, asking for a status update. 

What does that former student developer do (who now has an actual job and real development experience under
their belt)?

### I have no idea.

And spoilers, I was that student developer D:. I completely failed the customer (who had at this point
paid 50% of the actual contract before I commenced work). 

So what do I do (or plan to do)? 

For starters, I plan on refunding every single cent they've paid me. Others whom I've asked have told me to
keep the money they've paid me, I'm against this idea. I haven't fulfilled my end of the bargain, and I don't
feel comfortable keeping the money. I've got a full-time job, and I can't find it in my conscience to keep
the money.

The next thing I'm doing is tearing this whole project apart and going over the things that have gone wrong.
This leads to the question:

## What went wrong?

1. Accepting any job offer because you're "new".
    - This one hit me hard. I took on a CRUD app because I felt it was simple, and I had the air of "I just
      learned about this in school, I can do anything". It's a good attitude to have, but I was really
      developing with ZERO idea of what I was doing. By the time I had learned enough about developing, 
      two years had passed, and I was now too busy to take up the side project again. 
2. Doing everything by yourself.
    - This really sucked. I had no one to ask for help, nobody to help get deadlines under control. I had
      worked before in an internship as a fully remote employee, but that felt different. I was able to
      set my own guidelines and deadlines, and I didn't really have anybody to answer to (outside the CEO).
3. Not setting realistic expectations.
    - Related to the first idea. I was so eager to start developing, and to start taking in money I basically
      said "Yes" to everything the client suggested I do. This just exploded the scope of the project, 
      with each deadline getting pushed further and further back.
4. Not keeping in constant contact with the client.
    - This is a big one. Working by myself meant I constantly needed to keep in touch with the client
      in order to validate what I was doing so I wasn't wasting time. I usually met with the client once every
      3 months, and everytime, large changes would be needed because I had proceeded to do something which 
      the client didn't see attended to their needs.
5. Not knowing when I was in completely over my head.
    - I'll be honest, I'm NOT a project/product manager of any sort. I was really doing this project blind and
      being new, I had no idea that the software development process could be so difficult to manage, and that
      software bugs could be so difficult to get under control. I was in completely over my head in terms of 
      managing the product, design, etc...I thought I could do it all. Turns out I couldn't. Which leads me to
      my last point
6. Not knowing when to bail.
    - Sometimes it's best to acknowledge when a project has failed. I should have tempered expectations earlier, 
      or to push back on the project deadline. Hell, I should have charged even LESS money, or reject the project
      from the outset once I knew it would take more than one person to accomplish. But I didn't. Pride got in my way
      and I was to stubborn to realize that I should've quit while I was ahead. Quitting earlier wouldn't have 
      wasted so much time, and I guess I wouldn't feel so guilty now.
7. Not setting devoted project time.
    - I worked on this project on a timeline of 'whenever'. This was extremely ineffective; I had no motivation
      to actually FINISH the project. 

## Conclusion

If I were to say one thing that lead to this project failing: **inexperience**. I had no idea that scopes would
explode so quickly, and that customers were so hard to please (I still don't know when scopes can explode, and 
I am definitely aware that customers are extremely hard to please). I had no idea of recognizing when something
didn't work.

I guess it boils down to a matter of pride. I was too proud to say I was in over my head, and too proud to 
say that I should've quit. I'm a better developer now, but I still wouldn't approach this project by myself.
I'd at least get a partner to balance out the workload. I know the limits of my technical ability, and I know
that I still need to balance my work/home/social life as well. 

Would I say I've learned a lot? Yes I would. I've had to get over my own perception of my technical ability. I've
had to get with the fact that software development is HARD, and that you just might not be able to do 
everything by yourself.
