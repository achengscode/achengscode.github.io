I've always liked programming. Ever since high school, when I was doing my introduction to programming class, 
using QUICKBASIC, all the way to my current job, where I'm using Ruby on Rails. I've had a lot of other 
experience using other languages, building everything from toy hobby applications, to fully blown enterprise
applications for large companies.


I haven't been programming professionally for very long (full-time now for nearly a year, with a couple intern
positions before that) and my current place of employment has afforded be the ability to start conducting job
interviews for prospective candidates. It's here, a year after graduation that I now find myself faced with a
very interesting question:

## Why do I program?

Looking back on it, it's a very strange profession that we as software developers have chosen. It's a very 
new profession too, something that's emerged soley out of the technological advances mankind has made over
the last 60 or so years. But it's something I love. There's just something about encountering problems that
others may never have seen before, and having the drive, the determination to figure out the solution.


It's also not the easiest job in the world either. At times it can be frustrating. At times there will be
days where I spend sitting, staring at my screen, searching for the right place in the code to make the
modification. Then there are days where I'll bang out bugfixes and modifications endless, with multiple bug-fixes
happening within minutes of each other. 


Those are the times I (as nerdy and cliche as it sounds) crave. The times when the solution comes to me in the
'Eureka' moment, and the feeling of elation for having solved a problem. THOSE are the moments I live for.


There's also a poetic quality to programming as well. I'll be given a task/feature to work on, and I find the
way I approach that problem is unique, and that I leave telltale signs all over the code. It's a bit like
painting a mural, but the mural is constantly being worked on, painted over and redrawn, by multiple
people. I know that (in the end), I can point to a specific part of the software that I've contributed to
and say, "Look at that, that's me". 


## So there you have it

The hard work, the frustration, the long days of just furrowing my brow and thinking. It's worth it! 
It's all for the elation that I get from wrestling a problem to the ground and crafting a solution
for it. 

That is why I program.
